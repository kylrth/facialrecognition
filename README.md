# facial recognition using the SVD

This Jupyter notebook provides a sample implementation of facial recognition using the singular-value decomposition (SVD). It contains a `FacialRecognition` class that provides the required methods, and explains how each method is used to recognize faces. The Faces94 dataset was used in this example, and is included in the repository (Source: <https://cswww.essex.ac.uk/mv/allfaces/faces94.html>).

## Getting Started
